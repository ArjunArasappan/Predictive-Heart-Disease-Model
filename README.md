# Predictive-Heart-Disease-Model

Developed multinomial logistic regression and decision tree models to predict heart disease in patients based a number of categorical and continuous health metrics, including resting electrocardiographic results, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. Compiled a data set of heart disease in patients from four locations (Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V) where 13 different health related attributes were recorded for each patient.
